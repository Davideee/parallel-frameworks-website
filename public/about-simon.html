    <p>
      Simon is a Frontend Developer who values clean, clear code, test-driven
      development (TDD), and browser applications that deliver robust
      functionality with an intuitive user experience (UX).
    </p>

    <p>
      While not coding, you're most likely to find Simon... well, sleeping -
      which is how he tries to spend a third of his life. But if you catch him
      awake, you'll likely find him cooking, running, wine tasting, strength
      training, reflecting, or spending quality times with friends. And if you
      and he are both very lucky, he'll be involved in more than one of the
      above at once.
    </p>

    <p>... Some combinations work better than others.</p>
